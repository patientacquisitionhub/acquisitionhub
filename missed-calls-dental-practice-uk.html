        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Our missed call recovery system automatically detects when a patient call goes unanswered and instantly sends an SMS response with a booking link. Your reception team is notified so they can follow up and confirm the appointment. This ensures no patient enquiry is lost."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Many UK dental practices lose high-value private patients because reception teams are busy with in-practice patients. Even one missed implant or cosmetic enquiry can represent £1,000–£3,000 in lost revenue. Missed call recovery ensures every opportunity is captured."
