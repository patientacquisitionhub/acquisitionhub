        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Dental Enquiry Management for UK Dental Practices</h2>

        <h3>What is a Dental Enquiry Management System?</h3>
        <p>Our Dental Enquiry Management System captures all patient enquiries from calls, emails, and website forms in real-time. It ensures that no enquiry is lost and enables your practice to follow up efficiently, converting more leads into booked appointments.</p>

        <h3>How does it improve patient acquisition for UK dental practices?</h3>
        <p>The system automatically notifies your reception team of new enquiries and sends instant SMS or email follow-ups. This rapid response increases conversion rates, particularly for high-value treatments such as implants, Invisalign, and cosmetic dentistry.</p>

        <h3>Does it work for both NHS and private dental practices?</h3>
        <p>Yes. The system is designed for NHS, private, and mixed practices across the UK. It’s especially beneficial for private treatment enquiries, where timely follow-up significantly impacts patient conversion.</p>

        <h3>Can it integrate with my current dental software?</h3>

        <h3>How quickly are patients contacted after making an enquiry?</h3>
        <p>Patients typically receive an SMS or email response within seconds of submitting an enquiry, ensuring your practice responds faster than competitors and enhances patient experience.</p>

        <h3>Does it help track the source of enquiries?</h3>
